<p><strong>Wednesday 13 January, 07.30am</strong></p>

<p>Given the current weather conditions, the University is invoking the Severe Weather Policy with effect from 07.30am this morning, Wednesday 13 January. </p>

<p>In this situation, the Severe Weather Policy states:</p>

<p>In situations where, due to severe weather, employees are unable to travel to their place of work they should contact their Head/Chair of Department prior to their normal start time (or as soon as possible thereafter). With line manager approval and subject to operational needs employees may be able to work from home, take annual leave or take unpaid leave as appropriate.</p>

<p>Heads of Departments are advised that this does not necessarily mean that all staff should work from home today or leave work early, but should use their discretion to ensure their staff are safe in their journeys to and from work. All University members should also take extra care as roads and pavements are likely to be icy and gritting is expected to be minimal.</p>

<p>The University will be operating as normal today. </p>

<p>Staff are advised to attend work as usual if they are able to make their journey into work safely, but to take extra care on their journeys as roads and pavements are likely to be icy. Heads of Departments are also advised to use their discretion to ensure that staff are safe in their journeys to and from work. </p>

<p>If you are due to sit an exam this week and you are concerned that you may not be able to make it to campus, you are advised to contact your department urgently in the first instance who will be able to offer guidance on the next steps to take. See the <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/academicoffice/examinations">Examinations website.</a></p>

<p>If you are due to sit an exam today and believe you will not be able to make it to campus, you will need to contact your department immediately. You will need to put the circumstances in writing to the department and the examiners will then consider the individual case before deciding on the appropriate course under the relevant degree/course regulations. </p>

<p>The situation will be monitored during the day and if conditions change, I will email Heads of Department with an update. There will also be an update on insite. </p>
