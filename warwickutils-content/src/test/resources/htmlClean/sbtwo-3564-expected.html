<p><strong>CEI&rsquo;s latest European project</strong></p>

<p>CEI staff are currently involved in a European project with the acronym BINNOC - formed from the rather unwieldy title of &ldquo;Building Innovation Capabilities in European Business Organisations through University-Enterprise Cooperation&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In this project a partnership of universities and local enterprise organisations from Finland, Lithuania, Spain and England are working together to produce an analytical business tool with an associated training package which is designed to encourage and develop business innovation.</p>

<p>Now, one year into the project, all the national partners have started the trialling of the tool with volunteer businesses. Very positive feedback has been provided by Brussels evaluators. A special contribution from CEI has been the creation of a second mechanism, specifically targeting micro businesses. In this way, we hope that the EU will get particularly good value for money! The BINNOC project finishes in September 2010 and the materials produced should be widely available not long thereafter.</p>
