<H6 id=aboutMe>About me</H6>
<P>Hello! My name is Mat Mannion and I am a web developer in e-lab, part of IT Services at the University of Warwick. I've been here since August 2005 and have worked on a number of projects, notably <A href="http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/" mce_href="http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/">Warwick Blogs</A>, <A href="http://search.warwick.ac.uk/website" mce_href="http://search.warwick.ac.uk/website">Warwick Search</A> and <A href="http://go.warwick.ac.uk/sitebuilder" mce_href="http://go.warwick.ac.uk/sitebuilder">SiteBuilder</A>. Before I worked at the University, I was a student here, and got my MEng in <A href="http://go.warwick.ac.uk/dcs" mce_href="http://go.warwick.ac.uk/dcs">Computer Science</A> here, specialising in robotics, artificial intelligence and fault-tolerant systems in my projects.</P>
<P style="PADDING-LEFT: 30px">I have also in the past owned my own web development company and developed, along with two colleagues, the website and Management Information System for a luxury London-based minicab firm.</P>
