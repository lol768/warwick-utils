<h6 id="aboutMe">About me</h6>

<p>Hello! My name is Mat Mannion and I am a web developer in e-lab, part of IT Services at the University of Warwick. I've been here since August 2005 and have worked on a number of projects, notably <a href="http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/">Warwick Blogs</a>, <a href="http://search.warwick.ac.uk/website">Warwick Search</a> and <a href="http://go.warwick.ac.uk/sitebuilder">SiteBuilder</a>. Before I worked at the University, I was a student here, and got my MEng in <a href="http://go.warwick.ac.uk/dcs">Computer Science</a> here, specialising in robotics, artificial intelligence and fault-tolerant systems in my projects.</p>

<p style="PADDING-LEFT: 30px">I have also in the past owned my own web development company and developed, along with two colleagues, the website and Management Information System for a luxury London-based minicab firm.</p>
