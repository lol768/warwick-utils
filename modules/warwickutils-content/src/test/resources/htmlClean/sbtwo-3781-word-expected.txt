<p>The Widening Participation team in the Student Admissions and Recruitment Office is organising residential <strong>Summer Schools</strong> on <strong>Monday 5<sup>th</sup> July &ndash; Wednesday 7<sup>th</sup> July and Monday 9th August &ndash; Friday 13th August</strong>. We rely on the support of academic departments to provide essential subject taster sessions, including lectures, seminars and campus based activities, and we are very keen for your department to become involved in this event. The residential Summer Schools aim to provide the participants with as full an experience of University life as possible and academic taster sessions are therefore crucial to the events&rsquo; success.</p>
