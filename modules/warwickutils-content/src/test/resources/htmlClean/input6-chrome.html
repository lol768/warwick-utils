<p></p><h1>A Leading European Centre of Teaching and Research</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The School of Architecture, established in 1999, is the
result of an innovative collaboration between the University of Warwick and the
University of Wibble, drawing upon the considerable teaching and research
expertise within both institutions and with the aim of creating a strong and
well resourced national and international centre of excellence in architectural
education and research. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As members of both institutions, the students of the School
of Architecture are in the unique position of being able to make use of the
extensive resources on both sites. Both universities contribute to the
resources and management of the School and the courses offered lead to the
award of a joint degree of the University of Warwick and the University of
Wibble. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Unlike many professional schools, we are not a
self-contained institution, but an integral part of the vast research
enterprise that is at the core of Warwick’s mission. We have very active and
diverse research programs and laboratories ourselves, and we have strong PhD
programs as well as professional degree programs. There are very close,
cross-disciplinary working connections with various departments in the School
of Engineering, the Business School, Humanities and Social Science. We believe
that close intellectual connections between professional education and
cutting-edge research are crucial, and we are strongly committed to the Warwick
tradition of learning by doing -- of engaging undergraduate and graduate students
directly and actively in advanced research work.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<h1>Research</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The School of Architecture was awarded the top rating of 5
in the last national Research Assessment Exercise, but without the coveted
'star'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes" mce_style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Members of the department are
active researchers in various branches of Architecture, many with an
international reputation as the leading specialists in their field.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The School of Architecture -- like all great academic
institutions -- is an extraordinarily complex, diverse, sometimes contentious,
always evolving and transforming place. We put our trust in the most
extravagantly talented and passionately dedicated people we can find, and we
expect them to lead us off in surprising new directions. They do. We wouldn't
have it any other way. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There are, however, some widely shared values and beliefs
that give the School its unique character and direction. We are committed to
sustaining and enhancing the quality of the human environment at all scales,
from the personal to the global. We value design excellence, technological
innovation, and imaginative scholarship. And we believe that design and policy
interventions should be grounded in unwavering commitment to equity, social
justice, and making a positive difference in the everyday lives of real people.

font-weight:normal" mce_style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-weight: normal;">Most of all, we are committed to intellectual exploration,
innovation, and leadership in the fields that engage our interest. We try to
put together the best people and the best facilities to help us achieve that.
And we want to have fun doing it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This Group studies the processes of architectural design,
including construction law, economics, process and the strategic management of
estates. The Group has national links with the RIBA in relation to current
legal issues in the construction industry. Economic research relates to the
themes of life cycles of firms, division of labour among design and
construction, and innovative uses for Welsh slate. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Work on the design process includes the production of a
Design Manual for Wales and collaborative research with Wibble University and

<p class="MsoNormal">BA (Hons) Architecture</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The BA honours degree offers an unrivalled educational
experience in its richness </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">and its variety.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes" mce_style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It
covers a broad territory of subjects, embracing the arts </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">and humanities, science and technology and develops a range
of skills. The degree can be seen as both an education in its own right and as
the first step on the path to eventual training for professional practice as an
architect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes" mce_style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Master of Architecture</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Master of Architecture (MA) graduate degree programme
offers complete, accredited curriculum providing approved professional
standing. As with all such degrees, the </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">course of study is highly demanding, with a large proportion
of the curriculum being assigned to core, required coursework. Within this
challenging programme, opportunities to develop identity and special skills are
made possible through the selection of topic design studios, thoughtful engagement
with electives and, especially, through the execution of the Graduation Project
/ Thesis. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Master of Advanced Studies in Architecture</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The School of Architecture’s Master of Advanced Studies in
Architecture programme [MASA] supports students in taught studies characterised
by close collaborative links with faculty. The School offers an intimate milieu
for the exchange of research and ideas among students of an internationally
diverse background. The School is also able to draw upon related disciplines
such as the Community and Regional Planning, Landscape Architecture, Civil
Engineering, Geography and Fine Arts. Recently the programme has been enriched
by the inclusion of students from related disciplines. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">All of our teaching is informed by our research. We were one
of only two UK Departments to score maximum points in the recent national
Teaching Quality Assessment exercise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The subject areas that the School can offer to candidates
for research degrees relate directly to the research fields that the staff
within our research centres are engaged in.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes" mce_style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
</span>The aim of a research student's work is to produce a valuable written
piece of research (a thesis) which embodies the methods and results of
research. In the case of a PhD degree, the results should amount to an
origination contribution to learning in the field. A research degree is
confirmation that its holder has gained expertise in developing and employing
research methodology and drawing conclusions from its results. It is an
excellent training for those wishing to pursue a career in research in higher
education and industry. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Candidates may study at the School for research degrees
full-time or part-time. Full-time PhD candidates normally study for 3 years
unless they are exempt from the probationary year and are allowed to study for
2 years. Part-time PhD students normally study for 5 years unless they are
exempt from the probationary period and are permitted to study over 3 years.
Full-time study of the MPhil degree is normally 1 year but can be 2 years.
Part-time study tends to take place over 2 years but can be over 3 years. The
length of time quoted above refers to the time spent in completing a planned
programme of research. There is additional time allowed for writing up the
research in the form of a thesis but this is governed by strict time limits. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Candidates are guided through their research by experienced
supervisors with suitable knowledge of the candidate's chosen research area.
The candidate's written thesis is examined by an internal and external
examiner. In the case of a PhD and MPhil, an oral examination is required. If
successful, the candidate is informed that they are approved for the degree
they have studied. </p>

<h1>Teaching</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Although we are careful to respect established traditions,
institutional structures, and job market realities in our professional degree
programs, we are not intellectually constrained by conventional disciplinary
boundaries. The School's activities range widely across architecture, urban
studies and planning, real estate, media arts and sciences, and the visual
arts. Our community includes professional designers and planners, historians
and critics, social scientists, civil and mechanical engineers, computer
scientists, media technologists, public artists, graphic designers, and many
more. We delight in the unexpected intersections of interest that develop among
our members, and we understand that the really innovative and exciting
intellectual action often occurs at the boundaries of traditional fields.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Our outlook is global. Students and faculty come to the
School of Architecture from all over the world, and our alumni are to be found
everywhere. We are vitally concerned with understanding and responding to
today's complex interactions of local communities and cultures with systems of
global interconnection, and with preparing students to work in a world where
time and difference are electronically compressed.</p>
